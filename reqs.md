# Trial Reqs

- Below is what we expect from the final product:

- The playbook installs a PHP web server and a landing page that says "Welcome to Flux7!"
- The playbook code is stored in a publicly accessible Git repository.
- Submit your repo link the day before the interview/meeting

We will schedule a 30-minute meeting for you to present what you implemented.

Timeline:
You will typically be given one week to complete the above. If finished sooner, let us know and we will schedule the call accordingly.

Discussion:
Prepare to present for 15 - 20 minutes. There will be interruptions in the middle as questions come up and further Q&A at the end.
